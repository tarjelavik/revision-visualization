# Revision-Networks

This repo contains code and documentation for the visualization component of the Revision project. The app is built with Next.js. It fetches data from the Birgitta-endpoint at https://sparql.birgitta.uib.no/birgitta-revision/query.

## How to run

Clone the project and cd into it:
`git clone git@git.app.uib.no:revision/revision-visualization.git && cd revision-visualization`

Install all dependencies:
`npm run install`

Start the app:
`npm run dev`

This should start a local development environment at port 3000.
